        My name is Md Shafayet Hossen, a motivated MERN stack developer with a
        strong interest in frontend technologies and application development. As
        an entry-level developer, I focus on building responsive, visually
        appealing user interfaces using React.js, while steadily developing my
        backend skills with Node.js and Express. I have a deep enthusiasm for
        learning and a commitment to delivering clean, maintainable code. My
        goal is to contribute to meaningful web applications that enhance user
        experiences and solve real-world challenges, while continuously growing
        as a full-stack developer in the tech industry.
